# An electricity company charges the following rates to its users:
# For the first 100 units – 0.06$ per unit
# For the first 200 units – 0.08$ per unit
# For the first 300 units – 0.09$ per unit
# After 300 units - 0.1$ per unit
#
# Every client pays 10$ for maintenance/support
# If the total amount is more than 400 units then an additional surcharge of 5% is added
#
# Write a function and some tests which reads from the electricity_bill.json
# and can compute the bill for any given user.
